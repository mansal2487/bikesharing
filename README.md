# Bikesharing

## Purpose of this Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. Specifically, we looked at the length of time bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Summary
As you can see, males and females ride their bike for about the same amount of time and checkout their bike around the same time. The biggest difference in this data is that subscribers checkout a bike much more often. In the future, I would create a visualization to see which gender has subscribed more. I would also survey riders who are subscribed and ask them why they subscribed (for fun, for work, for exercise, etc.) and survey people who are not subscribed and ask them why they aren't (already have a bike, use a car, physically can't, etc.). Once both surveys are done, I would add the data to the dataset and visualize what the most common reasons are to give me a better idea of which people I should be targeting.
